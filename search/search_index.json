For me, this where all the great ideas and innovation magic happen.  Once you have been part of a team like that - you never want to let the feeling go and always are looking to make it happen again.  This involves a lot of bridge building to connect customers, problems, specific needs and cleverly match resources and solutions to business models that can sustain them.</p> <p>As a founder of HYBRID Labs\u2122, I love mentoring the next generation and immersing teams into challenging topics like Digital Health, AI, and Cloud.  HYBRID Labs\u2122 has had three teams place #1 in innovation competitions within Digital Health.</p> <p>Lastly, connecting the dots for both clients and students is what I most proud of.

These deep industry experiences combined with attending graduate school focused on human-centered design (HCD) transformed me from engineering and solution focused to more product-centric and a platform thinker.</p> <p>More recently, I navigated deeplearning.ai certifications to align with modern AI trends as well as participate in the AI4MED community as a mentor.</p>"},{"location":"areas/#cloud-platform-thinking","title":"Cloud, Platform Thinking","text":"<p>For clients, I need to address their problems in the near and medium term.

Most of my earlier cloud experiences have been on Azure with on-premises lift and shift workloads.

DCAI is evolving fast a best practice but HCAI holds great opportunity are addressing empathy, trust and ethics which will be mandatory for long term success.  We are still very much in Narrow AI as many of the innovations are task specific still.</p> <p>My crystal ball? Something like:</p> <p>Data-centric AI (DCAI) -&gt; Human-centered AI (HCAI) + Narrow AI -&gt; Narrow AI extended by Geometric AI (richer representations) -&gt;  (Early) Broad AI -&gt; Connected, Informed Human-computer interaction (HCI) with integrated tasks powered by Quantum ML</p> <p>The AI landscape is moving fast.  In the medium term and a more disruptive future - I think Classic to Quantum ML is where a lot of convergence will eventually lead.  Main stream and laggards will continue to migrate workloads incrementally to the Cloud.  However, Big tech is already innovating beyond mainstream supervised learning.  Meta (e.g., LeCunn) and others (e.g., Bengio) continue to refine self supervised learning (SSL) at scale.  </p> <p>In parallel, Geometric AI approaches (e.g., Bronstein, Leskovic) will extend ML towards richer representation learning beyond structured and tabular data.</p> <p>AI will push more intelligence towards edge devices as hardware innovates beyond GPUs.  This will be the next gold rush.</p> <p>In the medium to longer term, Quantum Computing (QC) will advanced past noisy intermediate-scale computing (NISC) boundary limited to only &lt; 100 qubit use cases.
