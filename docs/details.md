## Publications, White papers, Presentations
I have had the opportunity to publish, share ideas both formally and otherwise.  Many failures along the way, but some made it to real world products and commercialization.

## Certifications
I really enjoy reading, learning and connected the dots between a variety of subjects.  I am always curious with how things really work underneath the covers.

I started with MOOCs as a way to augment my perspectives and learning.  Here are some I have tackled along the way.

I love to learn by doing.  I also love learning by teaching.

I am constantly experimenting from different angles and trying to share perspectives with others.  Below are a variety of areas I am exploring, kicking the tires.  Failing, learning... sometimes breaking through.
