# Details

More details here.  Along the way, a lot of learning and failures but also some breakthroughs that scaled to solve real world problems.

Like a skipping stones, each skip connects the dots to longer story. 

## Longer Story

I am passionate about making a real-world impact where humans and digital platforms meet.
</p>

I believe digital platforms can better empower all of us with connected information to make better decisions.

My recent focus has been within U.S. Healthcare, where I specialize in Digital Health Platform (DHP) strategy and implementation.  

With an interdisciplinary background, I blend industry-specific experiences (e.g., U.S. Healthcare, Informatics, Health Information Technology (HIT) with modern DHP capabilities such as AI, ML and Data Engineering).  As an practitioner, I stay current, relevant and impactful.  I really enjoy in bridging gaps between stakeholders and product teams and love oscillating between my design thinkng and geeky self.

Currently, I am an instructor with HYBRID labs where I mentor and build innovation teams. Additionally, I am an #AI4MED mentor with deeplearning.ai.  Lastly, I am active within Chicago higher education bridging Digital Health capabilities within Capstone programs through programs such as Chicago Connectory (Bosche and 1871).

</ul>

## Education
I completed a Bachelor's in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Purdue University and then a Masters in Human-computer Interaction (HCI) from DePaul University.  

## External Communications
Below are some examples of both formal peer-reviewed contributions as well as less formal community and interna sharing

## Certifications
I really enjoy reading, learning and sharing.  Connecting the interdisiplinary dots has always been a fun for me.  I always try to keep relevant with top MOOCS to augment my mentoring and learning.  Most of all, I always want to keep an open mind and consider many perspectives.
