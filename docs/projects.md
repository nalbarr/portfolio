Concepts: Data Science, Data Engineering, Visualization

## AI4MED experiments
My biggest conceptual and learning breakthroughs have always started with Andrew Ng's MOOC early works, courses and evangelism.  The are many other popular MOOC variants, courses and reference but for reason I always anchor Andrew Ng, Coursera, deeplearning.ai.  I am completed many of the certifications but my favorite project was part of #AI4MED track.

Concepts:  Radiology, Imaging, Visualization, GradCAM

## Halamka NLP experiments
I really respect John Halamka, MD as a Digital Health thought leader, clinician and family man.  I have been reading his blog since he started to blog and actually spent time analyzing his blog from a Data Science, Data Engineering and NLP perspective.

Concepts:  AI, ML, NLP, Sentiment analysis, Text classification

## Cancer staging API
This project was an early proof of concept (POC) that led to future HIT standard within cancer reporting within North America 

Concepts:  Cancer, Cancer staging, APIs, Functional Thinking, Domain specific languages (DSLs)
