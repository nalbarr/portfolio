These are projects that I am most passionate and proud of.

## Patient Empowerment for Seniors
SNOBIRD is a teaching case I use at HYBRID Labs for mentoring and teaching.  I found it is one of the most effective ways to engage students as it is based on some real personal experience but also the narrative and story is supported by a real world reference architecture and technology stack.

Concepts:  Graph Thinking, Graphs, Knowledge Graphs

Technologies:  React, Django, Python, NoSQL (graph store), Postgres, GCP

## COVID-19 Cases and Deaths visualization
This notebook shows COVID-19 cases and deaths data as pulled from {New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).  It started off an experiment but later turned out as an effective teaching tool during COVID-19 to show my own family how COVID-19 was impacting us at national and state level.

Concepts: Data Science, Data Engineering, Visualization

Technologies:  Jupyter Notebook/Colab, Python, Pandas, Plotly

## AI4MED experiments
My biggest learning breakthroughs for modern AI have always started with Andrew Ng's early MOOCs, deeplearning.ai courses and continuing evangelism such as [The Batch](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/).  There are many other popular MOOC variants, though leaders and references but for reason I always come back to Andrew Ng's ecosystem.  It also inspired me to become a better mentor and learner - all the time.  I am completed many of the certifications but my favorite is the #AI4MED certification.  It was the first time to explore learning along side with industry-specific use cases closer to real workd.

Concepts:  Radiology, Imaging, Visualization, GradCAM

Technologies:  Jupyter Notebook/Colab, Python

## Halamka NLP experiments
I really respect John Halamka, MD as a Digital Health thought leader, clinician and family man.  I have been reading his blog since he started and I use it as a data source for Data Science, Data Engineering and NLP experiments.  Since he blogs both about personal and industry together I find it useful for a variety of NLP tasks.

Concepts:  AI, ML, NLP, Sentiment analysis, Text classification

Technologies:  Jupyter Notebook/Colab, Python, Tensorflow, Kera, NLP

## Cancer staging API
This project was an early proof of concept (POC) that led to a future HIT standard within cancer reporting within North America.  It is abstracted a bit from anything proprietary or specific. 

Concepts:  Cancer, Cancer staging, APIs, Functional Thinking, Domain specific languages (DSLs)

Technologies:  Scala, REST APIs, DSLs, NoSQL (document store)
