These are projects that I am most passionate and proud of.

## Patient Empowerment for Seniors
SNOBIRD is a teaching case I use at HYBRID Labs for mentoring and teaching.  It has been an effective way to engage students as it is based on real family based narratives and datasets and implemented on relevant architecture and technology stacks.

Concepts:  Graph Thinking, Graphs, Knowledge Graphs

Technologies:  React, Django, Python, NoSQL (graph store), Postgres, GCP

## COVID-19 Cases and Deaths visualization
This notebook shows COVID-19 cases and deaths data as pulled from [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).  This started as an experiment but later turned out as an effective communication tool in showing my own family how COVID-19 impacted us at national and state level.

Concepts: Data Science, Data Engineering, Visualization

Technologies:  Jupyter Notebook/Colab, Python, Pandas, Plotly

## AI4MED experiments
My biggest learning breakthroughs for modern AI have been with Andrew Ng's learning platforms.  All of it - early Coursera/MOOCs, deeplearning.ai certification and now evangelism through newsletters and blogs of [The Batch](https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/).  There are many other platform variants, though leaders and references but I always come back to Andrew Ng's ecosystem.  Why?  The pedogagy really sticks.

Deeplearning.ai and community motivated me to become a better mentor and learner - all the time.  I am completed many of the certifications but my favorite is the #AI4MED certification.  Below was one of my favorite projects.

Concepts:  Radiology, Imaging, Visualization, GradCAM

Technologies:  Jupyter Notebook/Colab, Python

## Halamka NLP experiments
I really respect John Halamka, MD as a Digital Health thought leader, clinician and family man.  I have been reading his blog since he started and I use it as a data source for Data Science, Data Engineering and NLP experiments.  Since he blogs both about personal and industry together I find it useful for a variety of NLP tasks.

Concepts:  AI, ML, NLP, Text classification

Technologies:  Jupyter Notebook/Colab, Python, Tensorflow, Kera, NLP

## Cancer staging API
This project was an early proof of concept (POC) that led to a future HIT standard within cancer reporting within North America.  It is abstracted a bit from anything proprietary or specific. 

Concepts:  Cancer, Cancer staging, APIs, Functional Thinking, Domain specific languages (DSLs)

Technologies:  Scala, REST APIs, DSLs, NoSQL (document store)
