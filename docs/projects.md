These are projects highlight what I am passionate about, how I approach learning and examples of what I cover mentoring for programs such as *HYBRID Labs*.  Some of them are aligned with industry problems I have been recently focused on.  Many of them I also use for mentoring.


## Patient engagement
This is simplified example and reference architecture called *SNOBIRD*.  It relates to Patient Engagement for Seniors and their caregivers.  I use it for mentoring and onboarding HYBRID Labs cohorts as an entry point into learning Digital Health concepts and full-stack development.  

- Concepts:  Patient engagement
- Notes: *Graphs*, Knowledge Graphs, Graphs + AI, ML

## COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Visualization
This notebook shows COVID-19 data as pulled from New York Times.  It started off an experiment but later turned out to be a great teaching tool show my own family how COVID-19 was impacting us at national and state level.

- Concepts:  COVID-19 cases and deaths, Epidemiology
- Notes: Shows Data Science, Colab/Jupyter Notebook, Visualization (Plotly)

## AI4MED experiments
At least for modern AI, my biggest conceptual and learning breakthroughs have always started with Andrew Ng his original MOOC platform content on Coursera and the deeplearning.ai community.  Most recently, the #AI4MED course was the first certification that merged both an opportunity both learn and apply to what I was actually focused on at work.

- Concepts:  Radiology, Imaging
- Notes: Shows heat map overlay for image classification.  Extend this for an ML pipeline.

## Halamka NLP
I spend a lot of time in U.S. Healthcare especially within Digital Health sector and I follow John Halamka, MD very closely.  His work at both Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and now Mayo Clinic demonstrates amazing medical and technology leadership. 

I started to create a data engineering pipeline to practice data science methods and continue to evolve it as much as possible to align with recent AI, ML and NLP trends.

- Concepts:  NLP, ML, Data Engineering
- Notes: Shows AI, ML and NLP

## Cancer staging API
This project was an early proof of concept (POC) representative of how cancer staging works with North America cancer ecosystem and since has evolved within HIT standards community.

- Concepts:  Cancer, Cancer staging, APIs
- Notes: Shows Functional Thinking, FP, DSLs
