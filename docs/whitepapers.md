# White Papers

Many of these white papers were foundational to HYBRID Labs and custom methods I am passionate about.

1. [Smartphones to smart systems:  A survey of virtual personal (VPAs) and how semantic computing provides competitive advantage]
> This white paper was early thought leadership and inspired my research interests between human-computer interaction (HCI) and applied AI and informatics.
 
2. [Effective use of Contextual Inquiry (CI) for creating Task-based interfaces with SCRUM for small teams]
> This white paper was early thought leadership work during early Agile with customization for product development for task-based interfaces.  It was based on failure modes of not getting propery HCI methods prior to engineering workflows.

3. [Bridging Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Software Engineering and Healthcare Informatics using Interoperability Driven Design (IDD) approach to improve Task-based applications]
> This white paper was early thought leadership work based on industry-specific experiences with U.S. Healthcare and managing HIT standards constraints within engineering workflows. 

4. [Using Contextual Inquiry (CI) to surface design improvements for Task-based applications used for Laboratory terminology mapping validation]
> This white paper will early thought leadership work which articulated post launch design improvements where there are HIT standards constraints from a semantic mapping perspective.
