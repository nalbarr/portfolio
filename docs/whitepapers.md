# White Papers

Many of these white papers were foundational and early thought leadershp to HYBRID Labs and custom methods I am passionate about.

1. [Effective use of Contextual Inquiry (CI) for creating Task-based interfaces with SCRUM for small teams - Albarracin, Hernandez (2009)]()
> This white paper was early exploratory work converging human-centered design (HCD) methods with early Agile (i.e., SCRUM) and capturing challenges within complex domains such as Healthcare.  It inspired my passion for improving product discovery methods for task-based user interfaces.

2. [Smartphones to smart systems:  A survey of virtual personal (VPAs) and how semantic computing provides competitive advantage - Albarracin, Hernandez (2010)]()
> This white paper inspired my research interests with human-centered design (HCD) method for task-based interfaces that integrated with knowledge graphs, semantics, and health informatics.

3. [Bridging Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Software Engineering and Healthcare Informatics using Interoperability Driven Design (IDD) approach to improve Task-based applications]()
> This white paper captured key perspectives, challenges and learnings launching a U.S. Healthcare HIT standard within cancer reporting and how product discovery needed effective prototypoing that included HIT standards in parallel to validate properly with subject matter experts (SMEs). 

4. [Using Contextual Inquiry (CI) to surface design improvements for Task-based applications used for Laboratory terminology mapping validation]()
> This white paper is an extension of cancer reporting experiences with direct tie to modified human-centered design (HCD) methods particular to subect matter experts (SMEs) specialized with health informatics mapping tools.
