I believe digital platforms can better empower all of us with connected information to make better decisions.

My recent focus has been within U.S. Healthcare, where I specialize in Digital Health Platform (DHP) strategy and implementation.  As an practitioner, I stay current, relevant and impactful.  

Currently, I am an instructor with HYBRID labs where I mentor and build innovation teams. Additionally, I am an #AI4MED mentor with deeplearning.ai.

I completed a Bachelor's in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Purdue University and then a Masters in Human-computer Interaction (HCI) from DePaul University.
