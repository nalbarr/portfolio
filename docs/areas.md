# Areas Of Focus

Areas I am most passionate about ...

## Connected and Informed Consumers, Graphs, Knowledge Graphs
Ask yourself this question?  Does the platform or tools you or your team uses really help you?  

Clients often ask me *and* I ask myself as a remote caregiver of the Healthcare system.  Most of the time we are puzzled as we do not have many of the pieces of the puzzle to solve the problem in front of us.  We often never have the information accessible, available, and connected to make decisions.  

I believe modern graph platforms and knowledge graphs can empower better experiences.

## Building Bridges, Mentoring, Connecting The Dots 
I *love* interdisciplinary teams.  For me, this where all the great ideas and innovation magic happen.  Once you have been part of a team like that - you never want to let the feeling go and always are looking to make it happen again.  This involve a lot of *bridge building* to connect customer, problems worth solving, specific needs and solutions that can sustain.

As a founder of HYBRID Labs, I love *mentoring* the next generation and immersing teams into challenging topics like Digital Health, AI, and Cloud.  HYBRID Labs has had three teams place #1 in innovation competitions within Digital Health.

Lastly, *connecting the dots* for both clients and students is what I most proud of.  In past years, I have mentored over 25 teams of which we all together launched product innovations, new careers and value added relationships.

## Digital Health
I have been writing about Digital Health and Digital Health Platforms (DHPs) trends for years now.  At first as Healthcare IT strategist and practitioner, but later as a remote caregiver.  The latter has driven much what I am passionate about trying to fix in U.S. Healthcare.

## Health Information Technology (HIT) standards
U.S. Healthcare has a $4.1 T cost to our nation that needs big fixes.  The 21st Century Cures Act combined with a COVID-19 technology trigger has accelerated modern Digital Health Platforms (DHPs).  However, none of it will work or get adopted at scale *without* HIT standards.

Modern HIT standards such as HL7 FHIR and APIs and related data standards such as USCDI, SNOMED CT, etc. require practictioner monitoring and application.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Ever since I was an engineering student, I had always been fascinated with AI and what it might lead to in the future.  AI has gone through many evolutions - but I have mostly been on the applied AI side - *solving problems, building solutions*.  

From first order logic rules engines to ontologies to deep learning models, the focus has always been the same - empower humans to achieve their goals with value, at lower cost or risk.

Much of my current applied AI, graph thinking, and knowledge graph perspectives are grounded with working with SNOMED CT  and related product and implementation experts launching digital products.

More recently, I am aligned with Andrew Ng's data-centric AI (DCAI) and Fei Fei Lei's human-centric AI philosophy of where AI, ML, and DL are going.  For me, this involves empathizing with humans and their needs while still architecting high quality systems.  

## Cloud, Platform Thinking
For clients, I need to solve their problems in the near and medium term.  I need to listen and solve their problems which requires an objective, solution agnostic and cloud neutral stance.  It really is not about Cloud; more about using platform thinking to solve problems in the small, then at scale.

That said, my first cloud was Microsoft Azure.  Most of my earlier cloud experiences have been on Azure with on-premises lift and shift workloads.  More recently, both delivery and mentoring have been more focused on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) leaning toward more cloud-native, data engineering and MLOps centric architectures.  I am familiar with Amazon AWS and IBM Redhat Cloud but more practitioner grounded on the previous two.
