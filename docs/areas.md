# Areas Of Focus

Areas I am most passionate about ...

## Digital Health
I am have been writing about Digital Health and Digital Health Platforms (DHPs) trends for years now.  At first as Healthcare IT strategist and practitioner, but later as a remote caregiver.  The latter has driven much what I am passionate about trying to fix in U.S. Healthcare.

## Connected and Informed Consumers, Graphs, Knowledge Graphs
Experiencing the complexity of the U.S. Healthcare system in humbling.  Often times both the consumer and care teams do not have all the pieces of the puzzle to power experiences that matter.

They need information to be accessible, available and connected to make decisions.  I believe modern graph platforms and knowledge graphs can empower better experiences.

In past life, I had the opportunity to directly with the SNOMED CT informatics team and much of my graph thinking, knowledge graph and informatics training comes from those experiences.

## Building Bridges, Mentoring, Connecting The Dots 
I love interdisciplinary teams.  For me, at has been where all the great ideas and innovation magic happen.  Once you have been part of a team like that - you never want to let the feeling go and always are looking to build bridges to make it happen again.

As founder of HYBRID Labs, I love mentoring the next generation and immersing teams into challenging topics like Digital Health, AI, and Cloud.  HYBRID Labs has had three teams place #1 in innovation competitions within Digital Health.

Lastly, *connecting the dots* for both clients and students is what I most proud of.  In past years, I have mentored over 25 teams of which we all together launched product innovations, new careers and value added relationships.

## Health Information Technology (HIT) standards
U.S. Healthcare has a $4.1 T cost to our nation that needs big fixes.  The 21st Century Cures Act combined with a COVID-19 technology trigger has accelerated modern Digital Health Platforms (DHPs).  However, none of it will work or get adopted at scale with HIT standards.

Modern HIT standards such as HL7 FHIR and APIs and related data standards such as USCDI, SNOMED CT, etc. require practictioner monitoring and application.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Every since I was an engineering student, I have always been fascinated with AI and what it might lead to in the future.  AI has gone through many evolutions - but I have mostly been on the applied AI side - *solving problems, building solutions*.  

From first order logic rules enginers to ontologies to deep learning models, they focus has alwasy been the same - empower humans to achieve their goals with value, at lower cost or risk.

More recently, I am aligned with Andrew Ng's data-centric AI (DCAI) and Fei Fei Lei's human-centric AI philosophy of where AI, ML and DL are going.  For me, this involves emphasizing with humans and their needs while still architecting high quality systems.  

## Cloud
For clients, I need to solve their problems in the near and medium term.  I need to listen and solve their problems which requires an objective, solution agnostic and cloud neutral stance.

That said, my first cloud was Microsoft Azure.  Most of my earlier cloud experiences have been on Azure with on-premises lift and shift workloads.  More recently, both delivery and mentoring have been more focused on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) leaning toward more cloud-native, data engineering and MLOps centric architectures.  I am familiar with Amazon AWS and IBM Redhat Cloud but more practictioner grounded on the previous two.
