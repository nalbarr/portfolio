# Areas Of Focus

Areas I am most passionate about ...

## Connected and Informed Consumers, Graphs, Knowledge Graphs
Ask yourself this question?  Does the product you use really help you?  Do you find yourself having to look for right information but get frustated?  So much - you may even look for another product?   

Clients often ask me this to solve their industry-specific problems.  Enter the accelerating industry trend of the *Connected and Informed Consumer*.  

A more *tangible* example...

As a remote caregiver of the U.S.  Healthcare system, *I ask myself* - we often never have the right information accessible, available, and connected to make decisions.  Most of the time we as a *product consumers* are not empowered to solve the problem in front of us.  

I believe digital platforms powered by modern graph platforms, knowledge graphs, Cloud and AI can get us all closer to the desired product experience.

## Building Bridges, Mentoring, Connecting The Dots 
I *love* interdisciplinary teams.  For me, this where all the great ideas and innovation magic happen.  Once you have been part of a team like that - you never want to let the feeling go and always are looking to make it happen again.  This involves a lot of *bridge building* to connect customers, problems, specific needs and cleverly match resources and solutions to business models that can sustain them.

As a founder of *HYBRID Labs*&trade;, I love *mentoring* the next generation and immersing teams into challenging topics like Digital Health, AI, and Cloud.  *HYBRID Labs*&trade; has had three teams place #1 in innovation competitions within Digital Health.

Lastly, *connecting the dots* for both clients and students is what I most proud of.  In past years, I have mentored over 25 teams of which we all together launched product innovations, new careers and value added relationships.

## Digital Health
I have been writing about Digital Health and Digital Health Platforms (DHPs) trends for years now.  At first as Healthcare IT strategist and practitioner, but later as a remote caregiver.  The latter has driven much what I am passionate about trying to fix in U.S. Healthcare.

## Health Information Technology (HIT) standards
U.S. Healthcare has a $4.1 T cost to our nation that needs big fixes.  The 21st Century Cures Act combined with a COVID-19 technology trigger has accelerated modern Digital Health Platforms (DHPs).  However, none of it will work or get adopted at scale *without* HIT standards.

Modern HIT standards such as HL7 FHIR and APIs and related data standards such as USCDI, SNOMED CT, etc. require continuous practitioner level capability and skill building along with real world delivery.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Ever since I was an engineering student, I had always been fascinated with AI and what it might lead to in the future.  AI has gone through many evolutions - but I have mostly been on the applied AI side - *solving problems, building solutions*.  

From first order logic rules engines to ontologies to deep learning models, the focus has always been the same - empower humans to achieve their goals with value, at lower cost or risk.

Much of my current applied AI, graph thinking, and knowledge graph perspectives are grounded with working with SNOMED CT and informatics experts launching digital products.  These deep industry experiences combined with attending graduate school with a heavy focus on human-centered design (HCD) transformed be to be product centered versus only wearing the *engineering* hat.

More recently, I navigated much of the deeplearning.ai certifications to fully indoctroniate in modern AI trends.

What are my current perspectives?  I am fully aligned with Andrew Ng's data-centric AI (DCAI) near term *but* Fei Fei Lei's human-centric AI philosophy of where AI, ML, and DL is where the hockey puck is going.  So, Data-centric and pragmatic in the short term with a vision and alignment for empathy, trust and ethics in the long term.

## Cloud, Platform Thinking
For clients, I need to solve their problems in the near and medium term.  I need to listen and solve their problems which requires an objective, solution agnostic and cloud neutral stance.  It really is not about Cloud; more about using platform thinking to solve problems in the small, then at scale.

That said, my first cloud was Microsoft Azure.  Most of my earlier cloud experiences have been on Azure with on-premises lift and shift workloads.  More recently, both delivery and mentoring have been more focused on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) leaning toward more cloud-native, data engineering and MLOps centric architectures.  I am familiar with Amazon AWS and IBM Redhat Cloud but more practitioner grounded on the previous two.
